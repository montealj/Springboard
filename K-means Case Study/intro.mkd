In this case study, you will implement the K-Means clustering algorithm, find the value for K using the Elbow method, the Silhouette method, and the Gap statistic, and visualize the clusters with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). You'll use real data containing information on marketing newsletters and email campaigns, as well as transaction-level data from customers.

This case study is tiered, and we recommend you start at Tier 3 if you can manage it. If you struggle, feel free to check out lower tier for assistance.
